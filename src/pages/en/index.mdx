# Introduction

## What is two00.com?

two00.com is an application that helps software developers or companies to monitor all their applications, systems and server tasks and notify you if something is not working properly so that you have more time to focus on more important things - such as developing your software applications, systems or server tasks - to take care of.

### Why is that important?

I'll give you an example:

You have a company that operates a webshop and of course you want your customers to always have the opportunity to order the goods that they have placed in the shopping cart in real time.

Your webshop has the following metrics:

- 100 visitors per hour
- 10% Shopping Cart Conversion = 10 visitors put products in their shopping cart
- 40% Order Conversion = 4 visitors buy the products they have placed in their shopping cart
- A user spends on average 100€ per purchase = 400€ per hour

Imagine, a part of your application is missing and the visitors can add products to the shopping cart, but no longer complete the order process.

You notice the error the next day when one of the visitors wrote an email to customer service. You can fix the error within 2 hours, but in the meantime 13 hours have passed and you have incurred a loss of € 5,300.00.

This would not have happened if you had set up an Uptime Monitor for your application. We would have informed you immediately if your application is not working properly anymore. According to this, you could probably have solved the problem in the shortest possible time and made at least 4,500€ more revenue.

## Which monitors can I set up with two00.com?

two00.com currently allows you to set up 3 different types of monitors:

1. Server Monitors
2. Uptime Monitors
3. Cron Job Monitors

A server monitor is set up on your server and gives two00.com a report once a minute about the current state of your server's well-being. If there are any problems, we will notify you immediately.

An uptime monitor is set up on our servers and allows you to ping endpoints (URLs) once a minute. If this endpoint does not report the expected status code, we will notify you immediately.

A Cronjob monitor is installed on your server. Any task that runs on your server at a controlled interval (usually a cronjob) can be monitored. If this task is not finished within the desired time, we will notify you immediately.
